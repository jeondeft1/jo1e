		Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you.

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve.

They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve.

They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.

To be honest, there are so many unsaid things as the outcome of too much drama and too many cool offs, I've even plan before the most difficult thing I could possibly do, like saying goodbye or even going on with our lives even it means for the best of us, but I simply can't do it cause you're the best for me. after all this time I shared with you, I don't think i'll ever forget you even in my hundreds of eternity, I know I'm not the easiest one to love but every ounce I have, I'll invest in you. 

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

Wrapping up our third month anniversary since Jan. 18 when we decided to commemorate it and chose to try our very best and start all over again, it comes to say that you made my life better, I found myself giving my all in, consistency and my best by being inspired by you to the point where I'm yearning for the future that has yet to come, and I'll continue to work hard for us and devote all of my effort and time to making you feel appreciated and loved as you deserve. 

My Adi please be patient with me, even while I'm going through my unstable scenarios. Please don't stop sacrificing and giving your all; I'll make sure you won't regret that you chose me. As for my plans, It'll be a long shot, and be prepared for some drama and fights till we're became filthy rich and I won't stop until I've given you all you want, and note that my heart will always belong to you and only you, my blessing from the Lord.

Hello adi, darna, ambi, and my everything, I'll start this by saying thank you for saying YES to a hundred of my red flags, thank you for being patient with me for almost 7 months when we first met, carried my back and trusted me for almost 3 months when we started dating, and finally, after an on-off mutual relationship with you, heartbreaks, breakups, and cool offs, you still answered me on 2nd of december, and a lot happened, lack of communication, heartaches, and I'm about to lose my mind, and you're still here to calm me down, my home. 

All my life I can't imagine being anywhere else rather than here with you, honestly, I'm not sure why you ended up choosing me but I'm grateful, you bring out the best in me, I fell in love from the moment we talked overnight, in that moment I already knew you meant the world to me, so I gave my very best and it's nice that you did the same for me and since then we've been history. They say that love is forever but your forever is all that I need please stay as long as you need, I can't promise that things won't be broken but I swear that I will never leave.

There are so many things I could say, but I'm sure it would all comes out exaggerated, pambobola, and so on. But please take my word for it that no matter how difficult it is, I will always choose to stay. See, the problem isn't you, it's me. I know, I can tell, I've seen it time and time again from realization to realization and man, that's been building me up to be a better person, you don't need a guy who can do everything for you, because I will be it, I can be it, I'll work for it because you're everything I need. It is kinda cringe right? to be this madly in love to a girl and telling her you can't live without her, but man, I can't even live with myself without the idea of you. I don't need anybody else since the fact that you're somebody else's fantasy makes me feel so damn lucky to have you.
